Why are internet comments so atrocious to read? Scum of the earth. Terrible bickering. Lots of straw-mans & other terrible arguments.

See Youtube comments as prime example.

Possible solution:
* Hellbanning trolls so they get bored (taking "don't feed the troll" to an extreme)
* Education on types of rhetorical fallacies
* technical solutions like voting mechanisms
* encouraging more responses from moderates so that the extremes are not the only voices
